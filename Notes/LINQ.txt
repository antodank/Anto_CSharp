Query expressions can be used to query and to transform data from any LINQ-enabled data source

A query is not executed until you iterate over the query variable, for example, in a foreach statement.

There is no performance diffrence between Query Syntax and Method Syntax

Query expressions can be compiled to expression trees or to delegates, depending on the type that the query is applied to. IEnumerable<T> queries are compiled to delegates. IQueryable and IQueryable<T> queries are compiled to expression trees.
