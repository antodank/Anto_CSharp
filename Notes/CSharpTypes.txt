Enum - 
is a value Type
is a group of constant variable
enum values can be auto incremental 
we can create object
we need to cast it use its values

When to use -
Its easier to maintain and understand
increases code readability


Value Types Vs Ref Types
Value Types - struct and enum
Ref Types - classes

int - 
is a struct
is a value type

string 
is a class 
is a ref type

Value Type - maintains data on stack
Ref Types - maintains ref variable on stack
			actual data  / memory is stored on heap
			Heap allocates memory dynamically and maintained by GC

ClassA objA = new ClassA();
ClassB objB = objA;

in above case both object referes to same memory / data

int x = 4;
int y = x;

in above case, both x and y variables holds its own value

Value Types default value is depend on data for e.g. int  - 0, 
value types cant have null value.

Reference Type - reference type can be null

Struct -
it helps you to make a single variable hold related data of various data types.
just define. initialization not needed.
